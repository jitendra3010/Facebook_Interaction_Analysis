# Facebook_Interaction_Analysis
This study presents a research approach for performing the metrics of Lifetime post-consumer for a post published in a brand’s Facebook page. The performance metrics extracted from a cosmetic company’s page were modeled. The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) for our final model is 6.000214%. The model was built on Lifetime post-consumer as our response variable. The dataset includes identification, content, categorization, and performance features that enable unique identification of each post, categorization of the post, and performance metrics such as post reach, impressions, and engagement. Other variables such as post type, category, post month, post weekday, and post hour are also included, providing a rich source of information for predicting social media performance metrics and evaluating their impact on brand building. The analysis of this model information may be used by managers to make decisions on whether to publish a post.

Understanding your customer base is essential for any business, especially on social media. Social media metrics, such as Impressions, Engagement, and Reach, play a vital role in creating an effective marketing strategy. These metrics help businesses predict the impact of their social media content on brand building. This study aims to develop a predictive model that uses the characteristics of social media posts to determine their effects on Facebook. By analyzing the factors contributing to social media success, businesses can tailor their content to their target audience's interests and increase customer engagement, leading to more robust brand building and overall business success.
